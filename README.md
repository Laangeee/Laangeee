I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in IT, Cybersecurity, information security and a dedication to solving complex problems.

Objective

As a Data Economics graduate with a strong foundation in informatics and data-driven decision-making, I have developed a growing passion for cybersecurity and information security. Through both academic work and hands-on experience, I've become particularly interested in understanding how systems can be made more secure, reliable, and user-focused. I'm now seeking a role where I can combine my analytical mindset with technical problem-solving — whether that's as an Application Specialist supporting secure and efficient system implementations, or as a Security Analyst identifying and mitigating risks. I'm eager to contribute to innovative teams that prioritize both functionality and security in today’s digital landscape.
